## RebelCoin (Frontend)


[Live Demo](https://AnoRebel.pythonanywhere.com)

Flask application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

**This is for educational purposes only**. This is by no means a complete blockchain implementation (nor does it aim to be one). Use it to learn how blockchains operate.

Code is licensed under MIT. (As [Savjee](https://github.com/SavjeeCoin-frontend), the Javascript version owner put it)

Feel free to fork, modify & improve it. Pull requests are appreciated!
